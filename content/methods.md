I use traditional, hands-on building methods. I cut wood using templates and a router, not a programmable machine. 

## Methods
You've heard "Measure twice, cut once," right? Well, not only do I measure twice - I spend a long time thinking through the process of guitar construction before cutting wood. Creating a tool to do a job perfectly - or planning out the right order of operations - is as satisfying to me as the first moment I plug in a guitar. 

My methods include:
- Hand-routed guitar bodies
- Set-neck construction
- Handwound pickups

## Materials
I like building with:
- Spanish cedar (not Spanish, and not a kind of cedar, but a great wood for making electric guitars)

## Finishes
- Oil
- Nitro
- Rubio Monocoat

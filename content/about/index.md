My name is Tak. By day, I work for a civil engineering firm. By night, I build guitars in my workshop. 

## Methods
You've heard "Measure twice, cut once," right? Well, not only do I measure twice - I spend a long time thinking through the process of guitar construction before cutting wood. Creatinga  tool

My methods include:
- Hand-routed guitar bodies
- Set-neck construction
- Handwound pickups

## Materials

## Results
I build guitars because I love seeing and hearing them make music. 

What can a handmade guitar do for you that a factory-made guitar can't? Not much. But some musicians feel that their instrument is more than a tool, and they know that a good song requires a good story. When you use a handmade guitar - when you've talked to the builder for weeks, or months, and gotten pictures of the build process at every step of the way - then your connection to your instrument is deeper, stronger, and more significant.

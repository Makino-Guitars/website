Classic formats in unique, iconic shapes.

The classic guitars of the 1950s and 1960s are classics for a reason: they work! Theyâ€™re the guitars that create the sounds of the music you hear in your head, and the look of rock and roll - that trigger your excitement when you listen, and your confidence when you play. 

I build guitars with a combination of traditional and modern methods. I use traditional hand tool woodworking techniques, and hand-rout guitar bodies and shape necks by hand. However, my design and production process include both modern processes like 3D printing and software modeling. 

The result is a well thought out guitar with its own identity, but reminiscent of the instruments that defined rock and roll - and sure to give you a special connection to your instrument, and your music.

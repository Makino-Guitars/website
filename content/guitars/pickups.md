Custom humbuckers, wound in-house, are available on all guitars.

### Standard models:
**Extra Special Brights**: Like the name suggests, these pickups are bright… and extra special. Featuring offset 42AWG winds and A2 and A4 magnets, these underwound pickups have an open and articulate high end. There is no mud here. Great for blues, indie rock, and classic rock. At special request - and with due warning - I offer the ESBs unpotted. 

**Foundations**: My take on the 7-8k P.A.F. ballpark, the Foundation set is versatile, great for anything from jazz to hard rock. I wind the bridge a slightly hotter than the neck to ensure balanced output. A5 magnets, 42AWG wire, and wax potting are standard. A 10% overwind can be great for the MMSG to fatten things up a little bit. 

**Redwoods**: The set for loud rock music, the Redwood set is designed to sound great carrying a bucket full of distortion. While louder and fuller than even the overwound Foundations, these pickups are still moderate output in the grand scheme of things. You’ll still be allowed back at the Tuesday night blues jam, but they might ask you to turn it down a notch. 

### Customize:
The standard models are starting places - I can wind you something special. Tell me about your sonic needs and I’ll use different wire, magnets, and winding schemes to reproduce the sound in your head.

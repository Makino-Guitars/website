## Pickups
I wind my own humbucking pickups. I use different wire, magnets, and winding schemes to make pickups that reproduce the sound in your head. 

We are spoiled for choice right now. There are small boutique winders and large commercial outfits making great products. I am also happy to use their pickups in my instruments. 

## Customization

These models are customizable. Let's work together on things like:

- Neck profile
- Pickup selection and placement
- Control configuration
- Hardware color 
- Bridge style
- Wood selection
- Finish
- Binding
- Inlay


## But...
My guitars aren't endlessly customizable. If you want a JM-style guitar that's semi-hollow with an f-hole, dual humbuckers, coil taps, and a Floyd Rose trem, that's great! But I'm probably not the builder for you.

That's because I focus on design elements that I think make great guitars - and the construction and processes that I can execute well.

The MMSG is a slab-body adaptation of the MM design. However, the MMSG features some major differences from other traditional guitar shapes and construction methods to result in a stronger neck/body joint - that means a stronger guitar with greater tuning stability and durability.

Super light, extremely comfortable, uniquely playable, and out-of-this-world tone.

It features:
- Unique Makino Guitars offset body and headstock shape
- A 24.75" scale length
- Set neck construction
- Two-way truss rod
- Bone nut

I build it with options around:
- Bridge type: TOM-style is standard, but we can do a stopbar or others.
- Pickup type and placement: humbuckers or P90s are standard, and we can discuss or modify pickup placement (especially bridge pickup distance from bridge). [See my pickup page](../pickups) for details about my pickups - or provide your own. 
- Control format and placement: a 3-way switch and 2x VT knobs are standard.
- Wood: I typically use Spanish Cedar, but also build with wenge fingerboards, [AND MORE]
- Details: inlays, frets, and other details.
- Finish: typically Nitro or oil-and-stain. See [methods](../methods) for more.

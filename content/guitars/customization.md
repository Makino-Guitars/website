These models are customizable. Let's work together on things like:

- Pickup selection and placement
- Control configuration and design
- Hardware
- Bridge style
- Wood selection and finish

But, my guitars aren't endlessly customizeable. I focus on the design elements that I think make great guitars - and the construction and processes that I'm great at. If you want a JM-style guitar with dual humbuckers, coil tops, cut-out switches, and a Floyd Rose trem, that's great! But I'm probably not the builder for you.

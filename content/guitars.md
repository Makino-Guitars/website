For years, I've designed guitars that have a unique but familiar look - and are built with strong, traditional, creative methods. 

## Models

### MM
The MM is a traditional, carved-top electric guitar with a 24.75" scale length.

Standard features:
- Unique Makino Guitars offset body shape and headstock
- Setneck construction

And I build with options around:
- Bridge type (stopbar or TOM style)
- Pickup type
- Controls

### MM-SG
The MM-SG is a slab-body adaptation of the MM design. Again, it's designed around a 24.75" scale length and my unique Makino Guitars offset body shape and headstock. However, the MM-SG features some major differences from other traditional guitar shapes and construction methods to result in a stronger neck/body joint - that means a stronger guitar with greater tuning stability and durability.

## Methods
I use traditional guitar construction methods. That means:
- Hand routing bodies
- Hand shaping necks
- ...

The benefits of this approach are...

## Customization
These models are customizable. Let's work together on things like:
- Pickup selection and placement
- Control configuration and design
- Hardware
- Bridge style
- Wood selection
- Finish

But, my guitars aren't endlessly customizeable. I want to focus construction on things that I'm great at, and that make great guitars.

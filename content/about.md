My name is Tak. By day, I work for a civil engineering firm. By night, I build guitars in my workshop. Little gives me more satisfaction than seeing and hearing people enjoy guitars I’ve built for them.

What can a handmade guitar do for you that a factory-made guitar can’t? Not much. But some musicians feel that their instrument is more than a tool, and they know that a good song requires a good story. When you use a handmade guitar - when you’ve talked to the builder for weeks, or months, and gotten pictures of the build process at every step of the way - then your connection to your instrument is deeper, stronger, and more significant.

The MM-SG is a slab-body adaptation of the MM design. Again, it's designed around a 24.75" scale length and my unique Makino Guitars offset body shape and headstock. However, the MM-SG features some major differences from other traditional guitar shapes and construction methods to result in a stronger neck/body joint - that means a stronger guitar with greater tuning stability and durability.

I build it with options around:
- Bridge type: stopbar or TOM-style
- Pickup type and placement. Humbuckers or P90s are standard, and we can discuss or modify pickup placement (especially bridge pickup distance from bridge)
- Controls: a 3-way switch and 2x VT knobs are standard, but we can modify.
- Wood: I typically use Spanish Cedar
- Finish: typically Nitro or oil-and-stain
- Details: fingerboard material, inlays, frets, and more.

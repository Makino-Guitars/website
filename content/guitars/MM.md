The MM is a carved-top electric guitar with a 24.75" scale length, set neck construction, and a unique Makino Giutars offset bodyshape and headstock shape. I build it with options around:
- Bridge type: stopbar or TOM-style
- Pickup type and placement. Humbuckers or P90s are standard, and we can discuss or modify pickup placement (especially bridge pickup distance from bridge)
- Controls: a 3-way switch and 2x VT knobs are standard, but we can modify.
- Wood: I typically use Spanish Cedar
- Finish: typically Nitro or oil-and-stain
- Details: fingerboard material, inlays, frets, and more.

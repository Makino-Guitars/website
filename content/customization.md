These models are customizable. Let's work together on things like:

- Pickup selection and placement
- Control configuration and design
- Hardware
- Bridge style
- Wood selection 
- Finish

## But...
My guitars aren't endlessly customizeable. If you want a JM-style guitar that's semi-hollow with an f-hole, dual humbuckers, coil taps, and a Floyd Rose trem, that's great! But I'm probably not the builder for you.

That's because I focus on design elements that I think make great guitars - and the construction and processes that I can execute well.
